Hi {first_name},

I love the work you're doing at {company_name} —  
I specialize in building high-performance websites, branding, and smart AI-driven solutions for startups.

If you're planning any upgrades, scaling, or even new digital strategies,  
I'd love to share a few ideas — no obligation, just adding value.

Would you be open for a quick chat this week?

Best regards,  
Madhavan A
